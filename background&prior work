Leukemia is a type of blood cancer that affects the production of blood cells in the marrow. It can be classified into different types based on how fast it progresses and which blood cells are affected. Since Leukemia is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow, it also leads to abnormal production of white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), and platelets. Early detection is critical for improving survival rates, but identifying high-risk individuals remains a challenge. Here are several factors that play a role in leukemia risk including genetic mutations, environmental exposure to cancer-causing agents like radiation, smoking, alcohol, and immune system disorders. Our dataset relies on blood markers such as WBC count, RBC count, Platelet count, and hemoglobin level to assess blood health and detect abnormalities. By analyzing these biomarkers alongside demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) and environmental factors, we aim to explore further in improving leukemia prediction.
