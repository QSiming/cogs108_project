Leukemia is a type of blood cancer that affects the production of blood cells in the marrow. It can be classified into different types based on how fast it progresses and which blood cells are affected. Since Leukemia is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow, it also leads to abnormal production of white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), and platelets. Early detection is critical for improving survival rates, but identifying high-risk individuals remains a challenge. Here are several factors that play a role in leukemia risk including genetic mutations, environmental exposure to cancer-causing agents like radiation, smoking, alcohol, and immune system disorders. Our dataset relies on blood markers such as WBC count, RBC count, Platelet count, and hemoglobin level to assess blood health and detect abnormalities. By analyzing these biomarkers alongside demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) and environmental factors, we aim to explore further in improving leukemia prediction.
Several studies have explored leukemia prediction by examining biological and environmental risk factors. Research shows that leukemia patients often have high WBC counts, low RBC counts, and reduced platelet levels. A study in the Journal of Hematology & Oncology found that bone marrow blasts over 20% strongly indicate acute leukemia. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and radiation exposure—whether from medical treatments or environmental sources—have all been linked to an increased risk. Additionally, a study in Cancer Epidemiology suggested that urban residents may face different exposure risks than those in rural areas due to pollution and industrial factors.
Genetic studies have also provided valuable insights. Papaemmanuil et al. (2016) identified specific mutations associated with leukemia, while Deschler & Lübbert (2006) explored how workplace hazards contribute to risk. However, most existing research focuses on isolated factors rather than a holistic approach.
Another prior work is a model predicting leukemia risk using the same dataset as we selected. By performing data cleaning on null values, dropping irrelevant columns like patient ID, and encoding categorical variables to numeric values, this work built a logistic regression model that achieved a 0.84 prediction accuracy on detecting leukemia with features and leukemia results provided in our chosen dataset(Devraai, 2025). Further exploration can be done on trying other models like random forest, or exploring the most relevant feature for leukemia risk detection. 
Our project aims to integrate blood markers, genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and socioeconomic factors into a single predictive model. By combining these variables, we hope to improve early detection, prevention, and treatment recommendations, ultimately helping to identify high-risk individuals for early screening and care.
