Among these, temperatures had been found to correlate with crime rate changes to some extent. Some studies suggest that warmer temperatures increase crime rates due to greater outdoor activity, increased social interactions, and heightened physiological responses to heat. Conversely, colder temperatures may suppress certain crimes, as people spend more time indoors. While previous research has explored seasonal crime trends at national or regional levels, there remains a gap in understanding localized effects across different cities and neighborhoods.\n","\n","To address this gap, our project will examine crime patterns in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Austin, three cities with distinct climate conditions but comparable urban structures. By analyzing crime variations across different temperature patterns and neighborhoods, we aim to better understand how seasonal changes influence different types of crimes. To reflect the present reality, we choose to study the past 4 years of data.\n","\n","### The Temperature-Crime Relationship\n","Numerous studies suggest the correlation between temperature and crime. Cohn & Rotton (2000)<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) found that violent crimes tend to rise in summer, linking this to increased aggression and more social interactions outdoors. Similarly, Ranson (2014)<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) found that a 1°F increase in temperature was associated with a significant rise in violent crimes, particularly assaults and robberies, while property crimes showed weaker association.\n","\n","However, the impact of temperature is not the same across all cities. Mares (2013)<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) studied crime trends across U.S. cities and found that temperature-related crime fluctuations were more pronounced in regions with extreme seasonal variations compared to cities with milder climates. Additionally, a more recent study by Choi et al. (2024)<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) examined temperature and crime correlations across multiple continents and found that cities with tropical/subtropical and humid climates, such as parts of Asia, had a stronger and more consistent positive correlation with crime rates. Meanwhile, in regions like the U.S. and Canada, where the climate varies and tends to be more temperate, some studies found a positive correlation while others reported no significant or even negative association.\n","\n","### Comparing Cities & Crime Categories\n","Several studies have examined how different urban climates shape crime trends. Harries & Stadler (2017)<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) found that cold weather significantly reduced crime rates in New York, whereas the impact was smaller in Los Angeles due to its mild winters. These findings suggest that climate differences affect crime patterns differently across cities. Our research builds on this by analyzing crime variations in Chicago, Austin, and Los Angeles to understand how different climate conditions influence criminal activity.\n","\n","Furthermore, past research has often overlooked the impact of urban structure and socio-economic factors on seasonal crime trends. Hipp et al. (2019)<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) and Block & Block (2018)<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7) found that crime distribution varies based on land use, accessibility to public spaces, and population density. Our study builds on this by analyzing how crime patterns change across different Chicago neighborhoods, providing a localized perspective on seasonal crime fluctuations.\n","\n","We already know that our dataset includes 34 crime categories, allowing us to analyze how temperature influences different types of offenses. We plan to categorize the 34 types of crimes into: Violent Crimes (e.g. Battery, Assault, Homicide, Criminal Sexual, etc.), Property Crimes (Theft, Motor Vehicle Theft, Burglary, etc.), Public Order & Regulatory Crimes (Weapons Violation, Liquor Law Violation, etc.), and Other Crimes & Offenses (Narcotics, Criminal Trespass, Deceptive Practice, Human Trafficking, etc.). By categorizing these crimes, we can better understand how different offenses respond to seasonal temperature changes.\n","\n","### Contributions & Research Gaps\n","While prior studies have explored seasonal crime fluctuations, few have directly compared cities with different climate conditions or examined crime variations at the neighborhood level. Our research fills these gaps by:\n","- Comparing temperature-crime relationships in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Austin, three cities with distinct climate conditions but similar urban structures.\n","- Analyzing neighborhood-level crime variations within Chicago, examining how different areas are affected by seasonal crime trends.\n","- Exploring how socio-economic factors and city planning contribute to seasonal crime fluctuations, considering variations in population density, economic activity, and law enforcement presence.\n","\n","By addressing these questions, our project aims to provide better understanding for criminology and urban planning, helping policymakers and law enforcement better understand seasonal crime trends and develop strategies tailored to different urban environments.\n","\n","#### References\n","1. <a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-1) **Cohn, E.

General and Seasonal Effects:\n","There would be a strongest positive correlation between temperature and crime rate in Chicago compared with other cities. Specifically, highest crime rates during the summer and the lowest during the winter, with spring and fall falling in between. The effect of winter on crime rates in Chicago will be the most extreme in the negative direction, as colder temperatures are expected to suppress crime more significantly than in other cities. Conversely, summer will have the most extreme positive effect on crime rates, with crime activity peaking during warmer months. We attribute this pattern to Chicago’s harsh winter conditions, which, despite some level of acclimation among residents, still force a significant portion of the population indoors, thereby reducing crime opportunities and leading to greater seasonal crime fluctuations compared to Los Angeles and Austin, where temperature extremes are less pronounced.\n","\n","2. Contextual Effects in Chicago:\n","We hypothesize that there will be at least a moderate positive correlation between temperature and outdoor crime, negative correlation between temperature and indoor crime. Generally, we expect that zip codes with a higher number of indoor infrastructure (such as shops, dining places, and libraries) will exhibit a high crime distribution when the temperature is low, and low crime distribution when the temperature is high. In contrast, zip codes with a higher number of outdoor infrastructure (such as sidewalk dining places, parks) will exhibit a low crime distribution when the temperature is low, and high crime distribution when the temperature is high."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tzgg0RBJw4KK"},"source":["# Data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gWcsEPEmw4KK"},"source":["## Data overview\n","\n","### Crime Report Data\n","\n","- Dataset #1\n","  - Dataset Name: Chicago Crime Report 2020-2024\n","  - Link to the source: \\\n","    https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2020/qzdf-xmn8/about_data \\\n","    https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2022/9hwr-2zxp/about_data \\\n","    https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2023/xguy-4ndq/about_data \\\n","    https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2024/dqcy-ctma/about_data\n","  - Link to combined dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucalai0502/crime-rate-dataset-austin-chicago-and-la?select=chicago_crime.csv (we basically just did a horizontal concatination to save space in here)\n","  - Number of observations: 1181859\n","  - Number of variables: 22\n","  \n","  We get the data from the official website for data portal of City of Chicago, and our dataset is in csv format.

Given that crime data and geographic location data are sensitive in nature, ethical considerations and privacy concerns are essential to our analysis. While we would not use any personal information in the dataset, crime records associated with specific zip codes could potentially contribute to re-identification risks. To minimize the risk, we will aggregate data at a broader level where necessary and ensure no individual-level tracking occurs. The dataset we are using is sourced from publicly available databases, including crime and weather data. We will ensure that all data sources comply with open data licensing policies and that we adhere to any restrictions outlined in the terms of use. Proper attribution will be given where required, and we will not use data beyond its intended scope.\n","\n","Potential biases may arise in how crime data is reported and recorded. Crime statistics are often influenced by factors such as law enforcement practices, socioeconomic conditions, and reporting discrepancies. Additionally, population and other variations in different geographic regions may affect crime patterns in ways not solely attributed to weather changes. To address these concerns, we will make sure to analyze whether certain communities are overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset, and use normalization techniques to account for population differences when comparing crime rates between cities. Also, we acknowledge potential disparities in crime reporting across different neighborhoods and cities. Our research seeks to explore correlations, not causation. To ensure ethical integrity, we will avoid making claims that suggest temperature alone is a determinant of crime rates, and we will consider confounders and try to identify other factors, such as economic conditions, law enforcement strategies, and community engagement, that may influence crime trends. Also, we will handle crime data and geography data responsibly, ensuring that findings are not used to stigmatize specific areas or communities."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PjdVvfD7w4Kh"},"source":["# Team Expectations"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rSAQzLKjw4Kh"},"source":["<!--\n","Read over the [COGS108 Team Policies](https://github.com/COGS108/Projects/blob/master/COGS108_TeamPolicies.md) individually.
